            <p style="text-align: left; padding: 50px;">COVID, also known as Coronavirus Disease, is a virus that has spread alll over the globe, causing a major pandemic that has taken its toll. The pandemic of such a large scale caused economic shutdowns, large-scale standstills, and more importantly, loss of life wherever you go. This pandemic is said to have changed the path of history for its wide effects on mankind. However, as vaccines are continuously being handed out, the effects we feel are slowly coming to a halt. That said, the advent of a new variant called Omicron is on its way to slow that impending normalization, as it wreaks more havoc across the globe. (WHO, 2021).</p>

As scientists try to find ways to make the vaccine more inclusive, Pfizer has now applied for vaccine use in children 5-11 years old. Should this be approved by the DOH and FDA, children in that age group will now recieve the Pfizer vaccine, possibly with other brands as more will eventually apply for approval form the government (Rappler, 2021).</p>
