The PASAMA Project: A WIP website dedicated to serve news.

This project is quite literally the project of a 14-year-old. Please expect imperfections and bugs if you even happen to come across this repo, or if you're my teacher then hi sir!

The PASAMA Project: Paalala SA Mga Madla
Dedicated to serving news and information to the people, from the people. Sources from different yet all reputable outlets and websites, with links for further reading yet a small 
summary in the form of a paaragraph for each news bit. Dedicated to serving true, unbiased information to the best of my ability.

Bugs be expected, easter eggs be found!
